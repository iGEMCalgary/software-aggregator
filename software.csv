Bologna,"We develop a matlab tool to analyze such kind of bacterium imagine that can be acquired in different format (jpg, bpm, tiff). For each segmented bacteria the software computes the size in pixel, the mean and standard deviation of intensity florescence. Main frame the algorithm reads fluorescence images and converts it into a ""black and white"" one. In the next step the global threshold is computed in order to convert an intensity image to a binary image using otsus method. The image is then ready to be scanned, pixel by pixel, to detect bacteria (cluster  of pixels) and obtain informations about their area, fluorescence mean and standard deviation.",2008
Edinburgh,"Background many software tools (such as copasi and simbiology) are available for simulation and analysis of biological circuits using mathematical models. Therefore we developed a web tool called mgec (modeling genetically engineered circuits) to address this issue. Through mgec, one only needs to tell which genes and promoters are assembled in order to form their gene circuit - a preliminary model in sbml format will be automatically generated for the circuit. Design of mgec database a key technology used for engineering gene circuit in synthetic biology research and the igem competition is the recombination of genes with different promoters. Therefore the focus of mgec is also on the promoters which link the signal, transcription factor (tf) with the regulated genes.",2008
Newcastle University,"One person was lead developer for each module, but the developers worked in the same lab, and had frequent formal and informal discussions in order to develop software which works together and provides the necessary functionality. Constraints define whether these parts can fit together. The workbench takes a user defined structure, together with a desired behavior, and presents this to the evolutionary algorithm. The evolutionary algorithm evolves potential solutions, starting with the provided structure. It generates a range of potential solutions by requesting different parts from the parts repository, assembling them according to information retrieved from the constraints repository, and assessing the fitness value of the mutated circuit based upon how well this satisfies the objective.",2008
