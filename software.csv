These specifications are required for the proper engineering of the trans and cis complementary sequences, whose functions are described in the t-rex device. Cis and trans sequences the cis-repressing (rna secondary structure in fig.",2009

UNIPV-Pavia,"Its a matlab graphics interface that allows you to align the results of the sequencing procedures with expected sequences, built up assembling simple parts (biobricks) according to the rules of standard assembly (modality of use compare sequence/biobrick). It offers also the possibility of simply align two sequences (modality of use compare two sequences). Sequencealignment executable files for windows platforms and the relative user's guide can be downloaded free of charge for non-profit institutions from the following web site: download sequencealignment.

ZJU-China,"In sequence optimization, bach incorporates 4 distinct approaches from which users can freely choose: synonymous substitution, slow, fast and match. In the last section of get rips, users are provided with a quantitative view of the translational behavior of the input coding sequence and the four sequences produced by the four methods as well. Run bach for the following research needs: heterologous protein expression evaluation of translation rates and behavior design of more predictable and robust genetic circuits run bach for the following benefits: diverse optimization approaches of choice quantitative analysis of translational behavior free and easy to use system requirement operating system: recommended os: windows 7 32-bit operating system minimum os: windows xp 32-bit operating system hardware configuration: no strict limits.

Paris Liliane Bettencourt,"We initially wanted to try to use this software to predict who would win igem, but  as it turns out it is useful for lots of other fun things as well. To analyse the wikis, we have implemented an algorithm that uses statistically improbable phrases (sip) to try and extract the meaning of a text, an approach which has been used recently by amazon to find relationships between books. An sip is a word that appears with a higher frequency in your target (whether it is a book, or an igem wiki) than in a large dataset of background text. More formally: f the frequency of the word in the target: f = o/n (o is the occurence of the word, and n the number of words in the wiki). Our algorithm uses all igem wikis as a background dataset, and then tries to find sips for each individual wiki.",2010

Warsaw,"Biobrick manager is extremely useful tool which helps you with planning your experiments or preparing printable instructions for others. It allows the user to download biobricks from partsregistry.org, connect them in order to obtain new parts, save resulting bricks as xml files and - what is the most important thing - to get protocol for creating that particular biobrick! Biobrick manager is the first program that uses biobrick xml representation! We hope that this xml will spread all over the world and make bioinformatic work in synthetic biology easier and more enjoyable. It's a web application, so you only need a browser and internet connection to use it.",2010
